## Key Findings

### Implementation Coverage
- **Implemented:** 46 methods (documented and implemented)
- **Not Implemented:** 80 methods (available in type definitions but not implemented)

### Documentation Coverage
- The documentation (both API references and guides) mainly covers the implemented methods
- The documentation does not include methods that exist in the type definitions but are not implemented
- There is a gap between the type definitions and the documentation for non-implemented methods

### Error Handling
- ✅ TelegramError class is implemented with additional context properties for AI agents
- ✅ Includes error code, method name, and parameters that caused the error
- ✅ Network error handling is properly implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Authentication (getMe)
- ✅ Message sending (text, media, location, contacts, polls, etc.)
- ✅ Message forwarding and copying
- ✅ Webhook management
- ✅ Basic chat administration (ban/unban members)

### Missing Functionality
- ❌ Advanced chat administration (restrict/promote members, permissions, etc.)
- ❌ Chat information and management (getChat, pin messages, etc.)
- ❌ Bot command management
- ❌ Sticker management
- ❌ Payment and invoice processing
- ❌ Game management
- ❌ Forum topic management
- ❌ Inline query handling

## Conclusion

The client implementation covers the core functionality of the Telegram Bot API but leaves out many advanced features. The documentation accurately represents the implemented functionality but doesn't cover the additional methods available in the type definitions. This suggests the library is focused on providing a minimal, essential subset of the Telegram Bot API rather than implementing the complete interface.

The implemented methods represent the most commonly used functionality for basic bot operations, which is appropriate for the library's description as a "lightweight, type-safe Telegram Bot API client".
